After reading the first couple of pages, Tom Raines (a good video game player)
raced a personwho said he was terrible and kind of felt bad for him… 
until he turned the tables. The person was shocked (and so was I) how a kid 
had just beaten him, on double or nothing. He also had teachers who 
would make a mockery with him since he was not smart and cool like the
other kids, he was an outcast. And there’s World War III going on and 
he was also poor with his dad and they were moving ALL THE TIME. Then, at 5:30
in the morning, he was in a parlor when he got an incursion, which is technically
a person challenging you to an online game, he had to get pass a bunch of technical
and physical obstacles and when he did he either had a choice to stay and fight
and probably die or leave and win, which he obviously left and won, but something
that he didnt know was that he was actualy being monitored by the <i>Military
</i>. 
<p>
<strong>They</strong> were impressed with him as it states, "You're quite the gamer. I'm 
impressed," (page 27, S.J Kincaid). They were so impressed, that they gave him 
the honor of becoming a part of the Military and getting a salary, which he 
agreed to, but his dad, had some issues. He didnt like the Military, he thought
that they were spies, always looking at them, but Tom didnt care,
so his Dad finally agreed and they left, and when Tom arrived at the base, he
recieved a MICRO CHIP IN HIS BRAIN, he was scared to get it, but then, he
decided yes. He was now a part of the Military and one of the most
expensive beings in the world and smartest.</h2>

After reading that i thought how it couldnt get more exciting.After getting the 
microchip in his brain, he heard noises that a normal computer would hear
he saw 1's and 0's (meaning binary code, im a such a nerd when thinking what that meant).He saw different places, he saw Rio de
Janero (a place in Brazil), the Grand Canyon, etc., etc (Pretty weird if i do say so myself but i think its normal since he has a microchip in his brain).
He knew his body temperature, everything someone needed to know (THIS WAS SO COOL, ITS LIKE HAVING EINSTEINS BRAIN IN YOU) He now had photographic memory with his new and improved microchip (So cool!!! I wish i had one of these in me)."You have a photographic memory now Mr. Raines" (Page 52, S.J Kincaid).
<p>
When he encountered his first friend, Vikram Ashwan, he was pranked by him
almost immedietly by throwing terms at him that would cause it to give
the definititons and aswell as getting him worried for a math test for his
first class of the day, but he had all the info he needed in his chip.
"Tom shoved at Vik's shoulder before he could throw out another term,"
When he went into a class called Calisthenics he saw a girl who he fell in love with her. 
Then, a person who he hated appeared. Elliot Ramierez. He is counted as one of
the best Marines for World War III and Tom was furious, so angry he might even punch him. But instead, he doesnt and greets him with a smile.

After meeting with Elliot, they went into a "simulation" (which i thought was so awesome since he is the best Marine in the world) of an old chinese town 
and which they battled with everyone and everyone having a battle role and Tom had
a rather adventurous role with being an attacking wolf." Then he heard a low rumble. Danger swelled on the icy air"(I got very scared here because I thought something was going to go wrong)(Page 95, S. J. Kincaid) He helped his friends in a way but that wasnt what he was supposed to do (i thought it was fine because he did a great job but his teacher seems to differ). The teacher called him a "lone wolf" but he was supposed to be a part of the pack. And the infamous Elliot Ramierez was one of the teachers and were very disappointed with how he did since he didnt help his team. 
<p>
Saturday morning, the day after the simulation, he had so much pain, he was hurt throughout his entire body. All his joints, mucles, and bones hurt. (I feel bad for him because ive felt body pain when we had to do wall sits with Dr. G, my legs were very shaky after doing the wall sits.) He couldnt even move an inch. He couldnt even get out of the bed. Day after Day, it got worse. One day, while fighting, there was an incursion, but one with Russians,they were the enemy of the U.S.A for WWIII, some of the best soldiers are fighting some plebes, or so they thought.

After some gruesome fighting they both ended up leaving but Elliot's head was chopped off by the best marine in the whole world EVER (I was actually expecting for him to win, like all action movies, the best ones win). Medusa. Medusa is the most powerful soldier in the world (I was shocked that they would even fight during class). And Tom was obsessed with her (I think that they will like each other because of how he feels for her). He found every war that she ever fought and tried to immatate what she did. He made more friends throughout the year. He met one of the best coders and mathematicians for a Marine. Wyatt. She was sitting where Vik was supposed to be when he woke up. He was shocked and asked why she was there. She wanted to know what he does in his free time. Which he showed her that he plays VR and how she plays many strategy games. (I personnally like Strategy video games, so i couldnt disagree with Wyatt). 
<p>
After talking with Wyatt,he gets coordinates and Vik walks in. He asks what CA 7.3 (8.9-10.3) means. He has no idea so he tells him to go to the infirmary (Good Job Vik! Thats what I would do if something is wrong with someone). Listening to Vik he goes to infirmary and on the way he gets bullied by some of the Genghises, a house of plebes, because one of the teachers made him into a dog. "Im sorry I turned you into a dog, thanks for not telling Blackburn," (Page 139, S.J Kincaid). He starts running away but they try to catch up to him. But people from the Alexanders and Hannibals dorm help him with the Genghises (I think he might have new friends because of what just happened to him).

After going to the infirmary, he continued with his classes until something weird happened during one of his classes with Eliott, its called Applied Simulations (Very boring name, just to speak for everyone). During a Applied Sims (Thats what the people in the book call it) an incursion happened (a suprise present). This happened before last time, but they upgraded their firewall so people cant get in, but it happened and guess who it was again, the russians but different. They had all of their best soldiers, including Medusa again. It was his 1 and only chance since last time Elliot didnt approve. He asked Elliot and he said fine, but it kills to have your body chopped.
<p>
<!-- When fighting, he saw the one and only , he didnt immedietly go after Medusa, but went for Medusa's colleagues so it would only be them. He killed most of them, then the most tense moment of all, fighting Medusa. When fighting Medusa, he made some of the weirdest comments EVER (If i said anything like he said I would probably DIE). "I think about you all the time," (Page 187, S.J Kincaid) (HAHAHAHAHAHAHAH this made me so confused yet made me laugh so hard, my parents thought I was choking). They fought an all out world before Medusa ended Tom the same way Medusa ended Eliott, just a little different, a little bit more tired. Everyone was surprised because he was just a plebe, an underdog. (surprised after they mentioned this). -->
<p>
After that happened most of CamCo, the top people in the Marines and the highest ranking group you could get to, were sent to go help with some stuff reguarding what just happened with the incursion (something that finally made sense in this book). After a couple days of the incursion the Applied sims are having War Games (probably the least fun name during the time period they are). Where they have to code viruses to implant into eachother's microchip. And let the Games Begin (good ending sentence Amaury! Thanks Past Amaury!).

During the 1st day of the compition, Vik and Tom became the Doctors of Doom. And one of the BEST coders they've seen, Wyatt. After a couple of days into the competition, Wyatt has coded many viruses and included one student who spread the virus while walking through a group, one of her best viruses yet!
Aswell as people getting worried of getting a virus because everytime they implanted their microchip/Neural processor for new info, they think they would get a virus. On the final day of the compitition Vik and Tom have created several viruses to take down Wyatt, but when they go to attack her, she figures out their scheme (OMG, HOWWWWWWWWWWW, I am so shocked that she did that!!!!) She figured out how Vik was hiding somewhere, where they would be to attack her and how she knew that they were going to all out but then something unexpected happened. (I was very anxious when reading this becasue i was reading really fast, trying to read what was going to happen next because i NEEDED to know what happened, and how!!) A new announcement came 
from their Neural processor."Time is 1900. War Games are concluded" (227, S.J Kincaid). 
<p>
(NO WAY!! She outbested them!!) Vik and Tom were very surprised in how she did this. But something else became intringuing. Mr. Blackburn came out of nowhere to reveal how he was expecting something more climatic. But then, he figured out who
the real hacker is, who changed all the profiles and went into the database, Wyatt. She was suprised, and Tom knew about this because, when he met her she changed the status of Tom and Vik! (Shocker because i didnt even know that Mr. Blackburn would even figure it out!!) Tom tried to protect her but she gave in and she was in big trouble.
She was either going to get her Neural processor taken out or she was going to be taken out of the coding class, She chose to get out of the coding class. (she was so good at coding, i cant believe that Mr.Blackburn figured it out, i feel bad for her even thought it was Illegal). After 3 days of what had happened
Tom and Vik saw her working with Mr.Blackburn in his office.

After a whole bunch of stuff happened after the War Games have ended, But recently, his step-dad took hostage of him. His step-dad went to visit him, told him to go for a walk with him and walked with his Dad into a basement of some sort, where he showed that there was a cool lounge for him but then realized he was taken hostage and was given new info to behave like a gentlemen and listen to his step-dad and only his step-dad and one of his classmates also knew about this and also abused him by making him act like a dog, doing whatever his classmate, Karl, asked him to do,(Anger intensifies because shouldnt this count as abuse for what just happened?). As well as him getting debugged, being ILLEGAL (EVERYTHING INTENSIFIES BECAUSE ANYONE CAN GET INTROUBLE FOR THIS) by Wyatt and her new <i>BOYFRIENDDD</I> Yuri, a russian "spy", as Tom and Vik called him. 
<p>
  
And after being debugged, he noticed how Yuri was debugged, if he was a spy, he can track anything, SUPER ILLEGAL "You unscrambled him," (Page 289, S.J Kincaid) (SHOCK <i>INTENSIFIES A LOT</i> because she could get arrested for it!!! :00000). But he was debugged, and he didnt care about anything but getting revenge on his Father. Then, Medusa and Tom teamed up for revenge against Tom's step dad and Karl, which also, may have leaked some of the inside info for them (0-0 oh, my, god, how could he do this, he just did a big oopsie, probably get kicked out, arrested and no more microchip). but he then drowned and killed them (shocked at the fact how he didnt have any remorse for them).

After killing his Dad and Karl (Not horrifying at all)  he plays a cool game in his Programming class, but still no Wyatt to be seen. But for some reason, Mr. Blackburn, chose him to be the main player, a fox, to run away from people trying to attack him with code. But he thinks that's unfair, (I agree with this statement too, pretty selfish of Mr. Blackburn to do this pain to Tom) meaning how he can't code well and can't protect himself with code. Mr. Blackburn actually agrees with his statement and asks Nigel, the person who gave a virus by walking near them, got to play with Tom as playing the main character. They also got a 5 minute head start to hide away from them, so they did, and Nigel came up with a virus, one that could kill, a seizure virus. Tom stopped him because he didnt want anyone to die because of Nigel even though they would win. But then, he himself fell unconsious (WHATTTTTTTTTTTTTT).
<p>
  When he woke up, he was in a Layfette room and he was stuck on the bed and was asking to be freed. He was, by Mr. Blackburn. He asked why he was in that room. Mr. Blackburn explained "Grand Mal Seizure" (page 318, S. J. Kincaid). (NIGEL WON, HE CODED THE SEIZURE VIRUS FOR TOM). Tom thought Nigel had won, but Mr. Blackburn also said how if he wasnt stuck on getting rid of it, he would've gotten a day off but he didnt and didnt win the day off. There was blood on the stage, but he was fine and Mr. Blackburn was done, he decoded it.

After the whole seizure thing happened, there was an info leak. An info leak of people in CamCo, which is INSANE because of how many people's identity's will be revealed and everyone will be in a machine where it will go into his memory and how it will technically torture many people  with old, painful memories that will try to find other memories that are trying to be hidden. (WHY??? If this were real, this is what will crack many of the death row people to tell what happened before they die! TORTURE I SAY, PURE TORTURE!) After being told this, Tom was taken to Blackburn's office, but one of his instructors, Olivia, is trying to save him from Mr. Blackburn, because this is illegal to do but he doesn't care (Go Olivia!! Save Tom! Save Everyone!). 
<p>
  But, Blackburn took him in anyway, and then, torture. (◯Δ◯∥) After various memories that tortured him (which i thought was a little much) Blackburn saw something that intrigued him (0-0 uh oh, he found out, he's going to jail!!!) He saw how he was interfacing with the seawage to kill his dad."Your were InterFacing with it!"... "How is this possible?" (S.J Kincaid, Page 358) He was wayyyy more interested in this than anything else (phew, i thought he was going to go to jail, live his normal life ,and be bullied for how dumb he was.

After the whole torture sequence happened with Mr. Blackburn, he was saved by Olivia, after his daily torture sequence. All he had to do was defeat Medusa in front of the Marsh. (no biggie, just DEFEAT THE WORLD'S BEST MARINE, if i was in Tom's place right now, i would just keep on going with the torture sequence). He had a couple of days to plan with his friends on how to bear Medusa. The Best thing they came up with is to defeat her with a virus that will slow down her Nueral Processor. Remember, it was about 3 days until it happened, but they knew someone who can pull this off, WYATT. So, Wyatt coded up the virus, and tried it out on Yuri, but also, during the process of talking to Wyatt, Vik figured out that she unscrambled him. He was furious and was going to tell Mr. Blackburn ( What the heck Vik? I cant believe he would even think that because aren't good friends supposed to keep secrets, and this isn't anything!). 
<p>
Anyway, after that whole commotion happened, he was prepared to fight Medusa. Eliott, Tom, and Nigel were all going to be there for tom. But, when Tom and Eliott were alone, Tom was sabotaged by Nigel. Nigel was the one who told the Chinese about their Identities, Nigel was the one who told his Dad about him. He was the worst person to him right now. He thought of what to do when Nigel was choking him down and he thought of what to do, use the virus Wyatt made him, but it was a one time use. (USE IT TOM, SAVE YOURSELF, IF YOU DIE YOU WONT HAVE A WIFE, YOU WONT HAVE THE FUN ANY NORMAL PERSON WOULD!) He put on the virus for Nigel, while he was playing as Tom, and was super confused and then "crashed" on the floor (get the pun?) Then when he took control again, he was heading for the place that they were in now but he turned around and went to fight Medusa, Warrior <i>v.</i> Warrior
<p>
When they were fighting he went for her ship going for the satellite, the satellite being the flag and they needed to bring it back to their base. All that he needed to do, was find space junk to use as a weapon, but he couldn't so he turned on his thermal vision camera and went to find the satellite, but then when he tried to become something, he thought of what to do and his brain did it, he went out of his body and became a old, clunky satellite with thermal sensors. He couldn't see Medusa though. Also, he learned how to morph into a new satellite and another and another (WOAHHHH, he figured out how to jump from an inanimate object to another) Then, when he saw something horrifying, Medusa "You're the same as me." (Page 404, S. J Kincaid). He saw Medusa go into Eliott's body and thought how he could get into one of his opponents but not her's. Then, he figured out how to win, but it was a dirty way to win. He almost didnt do it but he did and he made all the camera's point to him to see why she was called Medusa, her face, dismantled, destroyed. She was FURIOUS, so angry that she dove for an attack on him, after thinking for a couple of seconds, he knew what to do when they collided, a kamikaze attack. They were both killed and he also had the satellite in his hand. He yanked the cord of sending info to his Neural Processor and looked at the nearest screen to see what happened, the satellite was still intact and the satellite was in their base, THEY HAD WON!!! (HE CANT BE TORTURED ANYMORE AND IS BETTER THAN ELIOTT NOW!!!) The Marsh and Blackburn opened the door to his room and congratulated him.
<p>
A couple days after what happened he's been playing VR every day since what happened. Many things happened but that one time he went into his VR, something felt different, he saw Medusa's feroucious eyes. But he didn't care. He started hanging out with Medusa actually and they talked about what happened and then she turned to her true self, he asked many questions about it and then they both knew, how they would have to fight each other again, some day, some time.

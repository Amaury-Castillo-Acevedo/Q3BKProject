After reading the first couple of pages, Tom Raines (a good video game player)
raced a personwho said he was terrible and kind of felt bad for him… 
until he turned the tables. The person was shocked (and so was I) how a kid 
had just beaten him, on double or nothing. He also had teachers who 
would make a mockery with him since he was not smart and cool like the
other kids, he was an outcast. And there’s World War III going on and 
he was also poor with his dad and they were moving ALL THE TIME. Then, at 5:30
in the morning, he was in a parlor when he got an incursion, which is technically
a person challenging you to an online game, he had to get pass a bunch of technical
and physical obstacles and when he did he either had a choice to stay and fight
and probably die or leave and win, which he obviously left and won, but something
that he didnt know was that he was actualy being monitored by the <i>Military
</i>. 
<p>
<strong>They</strong> were impressed with him as it states, "You're quite the gamer. I'm 
impressed," (page 27, S.J Kincaid). They were so impressed, that they gave him 
the honor of becoming a part of the Military and getting a salary, which he 
agreed to, but his dad, had some issues. He didnt like the Military, he thought
that they were spies, always looking at them, but Tom didnt care,
so his Dad finally agreed and they left, and when Tom arrived at the base, he
recieved a MICRO CHIP IN HIS BRAIN, he was scared to get it, but then, he
decided yes. He was now a part of the Military and one of the most
expensive beings in the world and smartest.</h2>

After reading that i thought how it couldnt get more exciting.After getting the 
microchip in his brain, he heard noises that a normal computer would hear
he saw 1's and 0's (meaning binary code, im a such a nerd when thinking what that meant).He saw different places, he saw Rio de
Janero (a place in Brazil), the Grand Canyon, etc., etc (Pretty weird if i do say so myself but i think its normal since he has a microchip in his brain).
He knew his body temperature, everything someone needed to know (THIS WAS SO COOL, ITS LIKE HAVING EINSTEINS BRAIN IN YOU) He now had photographic memory with his new and improved microchip (So cool!!! I wish i had one of these in me).
<p>
When he encountered his first friend, Vikram Ashwan, he was pranked by him
almost immedietly by throwing terms at him that would cause it to give
the definititons and aswell as getting him worried for a math test for his
first class of the day, but he had all the info he needed in his chip.
"Tom shoved at Vik's shoulder before he could throw out another term,"
When he went
into a class called Calisthenics he saw a girl who he fell in love with her. 
Then, a person who he hated appeared. Elliot Ramierez. He is counted as one of
the best Marines for World War III.

After meeting with Elliot, they went into a "simulation" (which i thought was so awesome since he is the best Marine in the world) of an old chinese town 
and which they battled with everyone and everyone having a battle role and Tom had
a rather adventurous role with being an attacking wolf." Then he heard a low rumble. Danger swelled on the icy air"(I got very scared here because I thought something was going to go wrong)(S. J. Kincaid) He helped his friends in a way but that wasnt what he was supposed to do (i thought it was fine because he did a great job but his teacher seems to differ). The teacher called him a "lone wolf" but he was supposed to be a part of the pack. And the infamous Elliot Ramierez was one of the teachers and were very disappointed with how he did since he didnt help his team.
<p>
Saturday morning, the day after the simulation, he had so much pain, he was hurt throughout his entire body. All his joints, mucles, and bones hurt. (I feel bad for him because ive felt body pain when we had to do wall sits with Dr. G, my legs were very shaky after doing the wall sits.) He couldnt even move an inch. He couldnt even get out of the bed. Day after Day, it got worse. One day, while fighting, there was an incursion, but one with Russians,they were the enemy of the U.S.A for WWIII, some of the best soldiers are fighting some plebes, or so they thought.

After some gruesome fighting they both ended up leaving but Elliot's head was chopped off by the best marine in the whole world EVER (I was actually expecting for him to win, like all action movies, the best ones win). Medusa. Medusa is the most powerful soldier in the world (I was shocked that they would even fight during class). And Tom was obsessed with her (I think that they will like each other because of how he feels for her). He found every war that she ever fought and tried to immatate what she did. He made more friends throughout the year. He met one of the best coders and mathematicians for a Marine. Wyatt. She was sitting where Vik was supposed to be when he woke up. He was shocked and asked why she was there. She wanted to know what he does in his free time. Which he showed her that he plays VR and how she plays many strategy games. (I personnally like Strategy video games, so i couldnt disagree with Wyatt). 
<p>
After talking with Wyatt,he gets coordinates and Vik walks in. He asks what CA 7.3 (8.9-10.3) means. He has no idea so he tells him to go to the infirmary (Good Job Vik! Thats what I would do if something is wrong with someone). Listening to Vik he goes to infirmary and on the way he gets bullied by some of the Genghises, a house of plebes, because one of the teachers made him into a dog. "Im sorry I turned you into a dog, thanks for not telling Blackburn," (S.J Kincaid). He starts running away but they try to catch up to him. But people from the Alexanders and Hannibals dorm help him with the Genghises (I think he might have new friends because of what just happened to him).

After going to the infirmary, he continued with his classes until something weird happened during one of his classes with Eliott, its called Applied Simulations (Very boring name, just to speak for everyone). During a Applied Sims (Thats what the people in the book call it) an incursion happened (a suprise present). This happened before last time, but they upgraded their firewall so people cant get in, but it happened and guess who it was again, the russians but different. They had all of their best soldiers, including Medusa again. It was his 1 and only chance since last time Elliot didnt approve. He asked Elliot and he said fine, but it kills to have your body chopped.
<p>
When fighting, he saw the one and only Medusa, he didnt immedietly go after Medusa, but went for Medusa's colleagues so it would only be them. He killed most of them, then the most tense moment of all, fighting Medusa. When fighting Medusa, he made some of the weirdest comments EVER (If i said anything like he said I would probably DIE). "I think about you all the time," (S.J Kincaid) (HAHAHAHAHAHAHAH this made me so confused yet made me laugh so hard, my parents thought I was choking). They fought an all out world before she ended Tom the same way she ended Eliott, just a little different, a little bit more tired. Everyone was surprised because he was just a plebe, an underdog. (surprised after they mentioned this).
<p>
After that happened most of CamCo, the top people in the Marines and the highest ranking group you could get to, were sent to go help with some stuff reguarding what just happened with the incursion (something that finally made sense in this book). After a couple days of the incursion the Applied sims are having War Games (probably the least fun name during the time period they are). Where they have to code viruses to implant into eachother's microchip. And let the Games Begin (good ending sentence Amaury! Thanks Past Amaury!).

During the 1st day of the compition, Vik and Tom became the Doctors of Doom. And one of the BEST coders they've seen, Wyatt. After a couple of days into the competition, Wyatt has coded many viruses and included one student who spread the virus while walking through a group, one of her best viruses yet!
Aswell as people getting worried of getting a virus because everytime they implanted their microchip/nueral processor for new info, they think they would get a virus. On the final day of the compitition Vik and Tom have created several viruses to take down Wyatt, but when they go to attack her, she figures out their scheme (OMG, HOWWWWWWWWWWW, I am so shocked that she did that!!!!) She figured out how Vik was hiding somewhere, where they would be to attack her and how she knew that they were going to all out but then something unexpected happened. (I was very anxious when reading this becasue i was reading really fast, trying to read what was going to happen next because i NEEDED to know what happened, and how!!) A new announcement came 
from their nueral processor."Time is 1900. War Games are concluded" (S.J Kincaid). (NO WAY!! She outbested them!!) Vik and Tom were very surprised in how she did this. But something else became intringuing. Mr. Blackburn came out of nowhere to reveal how he was expecting something more climatic. But then, he figured out who
the real hacker is, who changed all the profiles and went into the database, Wyatt. She was suprised, and Tom knew about this because, when he met her she changed the status of Tom and Vik! (Shocker because i didnt even know that Mr. Blackburn would even figure it out!!) Tom tried to protect her but she gave in and she was in big trouble.
She was either going to get her nueral processor taken out or she was going to be taken out of the coding class, She chose to get out of the coding class. (she was so good at coding, i cant believe that Mr.Blackburn figured it out, i feel bad for her even thought it was Illegal). After 3 days of what had happened
Tom and Vik saw her working with Mr.Blackburn in his office.
